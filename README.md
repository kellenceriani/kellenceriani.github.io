## ✨ Live Experience

**🌐 Site:**
[https://kellenceriani.github.io](https://kellenceriani.github.io)

This repository powers my fully custom interactive portfolio — designed, coded, and iterated entirely from scratch.

It is not a template.
It is not a framework.
It is not a theme.

It is a living system that evolves with my work.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This portfolio serves as a central hub for:

* Software engineering projects
* Game development
* Creative coding
* UI/UX experiments
* Audio & multimedia work
* Personal technical growth

It is intentionally engineered to reflect how I think, build, and design systems.

---

## 🧩 Core Philosophy

**Build everything yourself at least once.**

This site is built using:

* Zero frameworks
* Zero site builders
* Zero templates

Why?

Because control → understanding → mastery.

| Layer     | Tech               |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| Structure | HTML5              |
| Styling   | Modular CSS        |
| Logic     | Vanilla JavaScript |
| Animation | CSS + JS           |
| Hosting   | GitHub Pages       |

No build step.
No bundler.
No dependencies.

Everything is intentional.

## 🧠 System Design

### Modular CSS Architecture

The styling system is intentionally separated:

* **base.css** → typography, resets
* **layout.css** → grid + structure
* **components.css** → reusable UI
* **aboutAnim.css** → animation logic

This allows:

* Fast iteration
* Predictable scaling
* Maintainable styling

---

### JavaScript System

#### `main.js`

Bootstraps the site:

* Event wiring
* Section control
* Initialization

#### `projects.js`

Dynamic project system:

* Project data objects
* Rendering logic
* Content injection

#### `modals.js`

Custom modal engine:

* Project popups
* Media loading
* Interaction logic

#### `customscroll.js`

Scroll behavior system:

* Section snapping
* Transition effects
* Controlled navigation

---

## 🎮 Interactive Elements

* Smooth scrolling engine
* Animated section transitions
* Modal-based project explorer
* Embedded media
* Audio integration
* Resume viewer
* Legacy portfolio archive

---

## 🕰 Evolution Included

The repo contains a full archive of my **previous portfolio**.

```
OLD_PORTFOLIO/
```

Why keep it?

Because growth is part of the story.

You can see:

* Design evolution
* Code evolution
* Skill progression

Most portfolios hide this.
I keep it visible.

---

## 🚀 Performance Approach

This site prioritizes:

* Lightweight assets
* No frameworks
* Minimal JS overhead
* Fast load times
* Full control of rendering

Result:
⚡ Extremely fast GitHub Pages deployment
⚡ Minimal runtime cost
⚡ Maximum control

# 🧬 Final Note

This repository is not just a website.

It is:

* a sandbox
* a lab
* a timeline
* a playground
* a record of growth

Every version is a snapshot of where I was as a developer.

And it will keep evolving.
